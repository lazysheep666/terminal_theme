## A theme based on hexo

### Usage

- Due to the template is based on the **pug**，making sure that you have installed the **hexo-renderer-jad** by `npm install --save-dev hexo-renderer-jade`.

- You need to create two pages-**about** and **tags**-by `hexo new page <title>`

- Due to my own demand, i did nothing to the catagories, archievs, and tags which are supported by the **hexo**.

- The **config file** is `_config.yml`.
